## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The challenge that I encountered in this project was coding javaScript. I'm fairly new to coding in JS but I managed to use the all-powerful internet to help me out in seeing what syntax to use to code in the project. My HTML and CSS skills were a little rusty but I managed to pull through the project.   While I was coding in the project I realized how similar the logic was to other coding languages. In fact, the simple logic in JS was similar to Java since it was used for loops and if statements. Overall this project helped me reconnect myself with these languages and apply them to a concrete scenario. It also sparked the enjoyment I always feel when coding as I have to figure out new problems. Knowing I will face hard challenges in coding is a challenge that helps me rise to the occasion and push myself to learn and apply my skills. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I may have a couple of questions about web development. One question I have is whether there is an interface or interactive platform that uses Java or C++ or is it just JavaScript? I ask this because while in school Iâ€™ve only learned more about java and C++ but really haven't seen those languages being used in websites so it had me curious. Another question I have is about how much code does a person contribute when he/she is working on a team? How are the responsibilities assigned? I was wondering if some staff just code all the program and someone else on the team checks their work and later edits and adds better logic for the program to run better. Or is the work divided up and each person is assigned to do a specific part of the program? I am eager to learn how to apply my coding skills to a team format.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would add a function or a simple if statement in the project so that the user doesn't interrupt the computer while it's playing the sequence because I noticed that the user can simply follow along while the computer is playing the sequence and get no penalty for it, which basically cheats the game if the user has no honor. Another thing I want to do in the code is add more buttons to make the game more challenging. Lastly would be to add another function that shifts away in front of the game as a record function that gets the user's button selection then later the computer plays back. I think it would be fun to make music with the user.
